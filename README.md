American football, known as football in the United States and Canada, is also known as a grill. It is a sport performed by two teams of 11 players on a rectangular field with goal posts at each end. On the offensive side, teams with control of the Oval football attempt to advance the course by running or passing, while teams without the ball control, ie defenders, aim to prevent them from advancing and control the team's own goals. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four games or go on the court, otherwise they will pass the football to the opposing team; if they are successful, they will receive a new set of four chips. Points are scored mainly by pushing the ball into the final area of the opponent's team to score a touchdown, or by kicking the ball through the opponent's goalpost. The team with the highest score at the end of the game wins.
